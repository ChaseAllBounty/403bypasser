# 403 Bypasser

This script aims to test various headers against a web server to see if any combination can bypass a 403 Forbidden error.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- `requests` library

### Install `requests`

If you don't have the `requests` library installed, you can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install requests
```

Usage

    Clone the repository or copy the script file into your local environment.
    Prepare your headers file:
        Create a file named headers_to_test.txt in the same directory as the script.
        Add headers in the format HeaderName: HeaderValue, one per line.
        Example:

        User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/109.0.0.0 Safari/537.36
        Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/avif,image/webp,image/apng,*/*;q=0.8,application/signed-exchange;v=b3;q=0.7

    Run the script:


bash

python your_script_name.py


Replace your_script_name.py with the actual name of your Python file.

Script Explanation

  -  Function load_headers(file_path): Reads a file containing headers and returns them as a list of dictionaries.
  -  Main logic: Iterates through each set of headers, sends a GET request to the specified URL, and checks the status code.


Example Output:
When you run the script, you'll see output like:

```
Headers: {'User-Agent': '...', 'Accept': '...'}
Status Code: 403
Request failed: ...
```

If a header set results in a different status code than 403, it would indicate:
```
Potential Bypass with headers: {'Your-Header': 'HeaderValue'}
```

Notes

  -  Legal and Ethical Warning: This tool should only be used on websites you have permission to test. Unauthorized attempts to bypass security measures are illegal and unethical.
  -  Effectiveness: The success of this method in bypassing a 403 error varies by server configuration. Some servers might log or block requests that seem suspicious.
